# must have already fetched NOTES_BRANCH successfully (see

# fetching again itself, so session-start.sh and save-plan.sh each fetch
# exactly once per run.

# per branch, generated fresh in full by ./save-plan.sh on every run (never

# YAML-lookalike matched by fixed-string grep: it's an unambiguous, widely
# understood interchange format - a tab can never appear inside a branch
# name or plan id, so a field-based match can't misfire the way a
# substring/prefix match on a YAML-shaped string could - while still
# needing nothing beyond `awk`, which every session-start environment
# already has (see the module docstring: session-start.sh must not gain a
