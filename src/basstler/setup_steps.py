"""
Prints the setup steps that live outside this clone, filled in for the fork the
clone actually points at.

check-setup.sh reports on everything a shell can inspect - the notes branch, the
recorded git identity, the dashboard dependencies. What it cannot reach is
everything held by a service rather than a file: labels in a GitHub repository,
Claude's access to that repository, and the variables a fresh-clone environment
has to carry. Those are the steps a first-time user is left holding, so they are
printed here as a short list with the values already substituted, rather than
described in prose the reader has to translate.

It also performs the one step a script can that check-setup.sh reports on but
session start cannot fill in for itself: naming the project's upstream in the user's
personal ``stack.toml``, which only the user knows.

It also installs ``/upstream-reviews``' Action on the fork's own branch, which a
script can do once the user has asked for it - everything but switching a fork's
Actions on, which is printed here.

Usage:
    python3 -m basstler.setup_steps
    python3 -m basstler.setup_steps configure-upstream --repository <owner>/<name>
    python3 -m basstler.setup_steps install-upstream-reviews-action --ref v<version>
