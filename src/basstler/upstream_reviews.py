"""
Report the checks, failing job logs and review threads a fork's pull request has
collected upstream.

It reads through whichever API the place it runs in can reach. A Claude Code cloud
session's proxy refuses GitHub's GraphQL API but answers REST for the repositories the
session has attached, with a review-threads route of its own carrying the resolved
state GitHub otherwise keeps behind GraphQL; anywhere else - a runner, a developer's
machine - reads through GraphQL. Both readers parse into the same models, so the report
is the same either way. ``gh`` is what talks to GitHub, rather than a hand-rolled client:
runners ship it, ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` or the session proxy authenticates it, so no access
rule is implemented here a fourth time.

Every repository name comes from configuration or the runner's own environment, so the
script works unchanged in any contributor's fork.
