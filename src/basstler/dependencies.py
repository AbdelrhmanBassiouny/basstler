"""
What this package needs installed, and which of it this environment is missing.

The declaration is ``pyproject.toml``'s ``[project]`` table: the package's own name and its
``dependencies``, so there is one list rather than a metadata table and a requirements file
that can disagree. A package installed as a copy, from its repository, carries no
``pyproject.toml``; its installed metadata states the same list. An
environment runs the package only with the package itself installed in it, so the package
counts as a requirement of its own.

Kept as a module rather than as a snippet inside the shell that calls it: the bash entry
points ask this question before anything is installed, and a question with parsing in it
is real, testable code wherever it is written.

Usage:
    python3 -m basstler.dependencies [--declaration <pyproject.toml>]

Prints one requirement specifier per missing requirement, and nothing at all when the
environment already has them all.

..note:: Imports nothing outside the standard library. It runs before any install, so a
    dependency of its own would be the one thing it could never report.
