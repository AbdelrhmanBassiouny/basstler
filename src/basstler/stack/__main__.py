"""Stacked pull request helper for the fork-staging / upstream-review workflow.

GitHub is the single source of truth. The stack is **not** declared in a ledger: it is read from a
``board.json`` export of the fork's pull requests, combined with plain ``git``:

  * dependency tree = each fork pull request's **base branch** (base = parent);
  * ``draft`` <-> ``ready`` = the fork pull request's draft flag;
  * ``in-review`` = the ``in_review_label`` on the fork pull request (the upstream is not readable from the cloud);
  * ``merged`` = the branch is an ancestor of ``<upstream_remote>/<upstream_base>``.

``stack.toml`` carries the shipped defaults (label names, the base branch); the project's committed
``.claude/basstler/stack.toml`` names its upstream, and a ``.claude/personal/stack.toml`` on the
personal-notes branch, if present, layers per-user overrides on top of both (see
:meth:`basstler.stack.settings.Configuration.load`).

Commands (run from the repo root; ``--help`` on any of them for its flags)::

    python -m basstler.stack status         # the whole stack: parent, state, drift
    python -m basstler.stack check          # would each branch merge cleanly onto its parent now?
    python -m basstler.stack next           # which branches to submit upstream next
    python -m basstler.stack next --porcelain    # machine-readable: one 'name<TAB>pull request' line per branch
    python -m basstler.stack next --context      # per branch: diff --stat against its base, commit subjects, description
    python -m basstler.stack restack-plan   # bottom-up restack plan as JSON
    python -m basstler.stack configuration  # every resolved setting, including the remotes
    python -m basstler.stack labels         # the complete label set a write must send
    python -m basstler.stack check-move      # may these commits move onto that branch?
    python -m basstler.stack promotion-link # the upstream compare-and-create URL for a branch
    python -m basstler.stack reparents      # children whose base has landed, and the base they need
    python -m basstler.stack landed         # open fork pull requests whose branch has landed

The last five exist so the steps most easily got wrong by hand are computed rather than recalled: a
label write replaces the whole set, a push whose two sides name different branches moves the wrong
commits, an unencoded compare URL loses its prefill, and a landed parent is decided by git ancestry
rather than by pull-request state. ``landed`` reports only - GitHub closes a pull request as merged
by itself once its head is contained in its base, so nothing here has to close one.
