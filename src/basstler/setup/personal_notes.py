"""
Performs the one-time personal-notes setup without a session: points the notes remote at
a repository you own, creates the notes branch, optionally seeds it and records your git
identity, picks the notes up in this clone, and checks the pull request labels the
tooling applies.

Safe to re-run: each step is skipped when check-setup.sh already reports it done. Exits
with check-setup.sh's own final status, so a setup that only half worked never reports
success.

Usage:
    python3 -m basstler.setup.personal_notes --remote <name-or-url> \\
        [--name "Your Name" --email you@example.com] [--starter-notes] [--create-labels]
