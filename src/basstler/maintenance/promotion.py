"""
Recording the upstream link on every branch ready to be promoted.

The upstream pull request is not opened here - the credential has no write access there.
What is written is the link that opens it prefilled, into the fork pull request's own
description, plus the label that stops a later pass rebuilding it.

What the upstream reviewer reads is a reading of the diff, so it is written by the caller
as a :class:`PromotionSummary`; the title, the link back to the fork pull request and the
length budget stay here.
