"""
Reading the upstream's open pull requests through the fork's own Action, for a session
whose credential cannot reach the upstream's API.

The session pushes an :class:`OpenPullRequestsRequest` to the fork's Action branch; the
run reads the upstream with the runner's own token and commits an
:class:`OpenPullRequestsAnswer`; the session fetches it. Nothing is ever written to the
upstream.
