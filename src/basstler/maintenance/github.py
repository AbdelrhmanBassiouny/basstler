Reading and writing the fork's pull requests.

The reading and the writing halves are declared separately, so a caller that must not
write - the board export - can be handed a reader and provably cannot. Every write here
was probed against the live API first: a pull request's *base branch* is the one the
credential a session carries is refused, which is why retargeting is reported for a
caller to perform rather than performed.
