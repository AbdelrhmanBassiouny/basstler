"""
The maintenance executor's hand-maintained values.

Everything here is a decision somebody made and may change again - the heading a promotion
link is written under, the label marking it sent. They are gathered in one module, each
in the enum of the values it is one of, so changing one is an edit rather than a search
through whichever module happens to read it.

Values a program derives for itself belong beside the code that derives them, not here.
