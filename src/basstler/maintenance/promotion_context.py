"""
What a session writes each upstream summary from, read for it in one go.

A summary is a reading of the change, but not of every line of it: the fork pull
request's own title and description, its commit subjects and which files it changes by
how much are what an upstream reviewer's first paragraph is written from. Each is capped,
so the context for a branch stays the same size however large its diff is.
