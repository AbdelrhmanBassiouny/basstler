"""
The stack configuration a project commits, layered over the defaults the package ships.

The shipped ``stack.toml`` holds what is the same for every project - label names, the
base branch - and names nobody's repository. A project names its own upstream in
``.claude/basstler/stack.toml``, committed beside its code, so every contributor and every
Actions runner checking the project out reads the same answer. The per-user layer on the
personal-notes branch goes on top of both, and is :mod:`basstler.stack`'s to read, since
a runner never fetches that branch.
