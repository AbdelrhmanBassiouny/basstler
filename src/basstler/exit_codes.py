"""
The exit statuses the package's commands end with, and the errors that carry their own.

Every command's table of statuses extends :class:`ExitCode`, so a status reads the same
way, and is typed the same way, whichever command it comes from.

An error a command reports to its caller declares the status it ends the command with,
as :attr:`CommandFailure.exit_code`. A command's entry point then catches
:class:`CommandFailure` once and returns ``error.exit_code``, instead of each entry point
keeping its own table from error to status - two tables that can disagree about the same
error. The error is the thing that knows what went wrong, so it is the one that says how a
caller is told.

The stacked-pull-request tools - ``basstler.stack`` and ``basstler.maintenance`` - share
:class:`StackExitCode`, so a caller acting on either one's status never has to remember
which produced it.
