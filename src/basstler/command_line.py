"""
One command of a command-line tool, and how a tool finds every one of its commands.

A command owns its own name, its own flags and its own work, so adding one is writing a
subclass: :meth:`Command.every_command` finds it, and nothing else has to be told it
exists. What a command is handed to run and what it answers with differ per tool, so each
tool's own base declares ``run``.
