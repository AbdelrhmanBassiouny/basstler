Shared rendering helpers for the plan-dashboard scripts.

No plan-specific content belongs here - this module only knows how to (a)
build the Jinja2 environment every page template renders through and (b)
turn generic markdown into HTML. dashboard/plan_page.py and dashboard/index_page.py both
import it rather than duplicating the logic.
