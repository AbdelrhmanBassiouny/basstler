every module importable on its own, every entry point reachable through
``python3 -m``, every workflow that runs a module installing its dependencies first, one

:mod:`basstler.package_layout` discovers the modules and the entry points from the package
itself, so nothing here is a second list of them, and the workflows are read from the
