"""
A pass over a large stack, built without git or a network, for the tests that bound how
much a pass prints.

Its shape is that of a fork with about 150 open stacked pull requests: most branches
already up to date, a couple of dozen pushed, a few conflicting on hundreds of files, a
handful promoted with full-length create-links, and a backlog of links from earlier
passes.
