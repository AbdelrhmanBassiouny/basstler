"""
Tests for reading an upstream pull request over REST, the way a Claude Code session can.

A session's proxy refuses GraphQL but answers REST, including a review-threads route of
its own that carries each thread's resolved state. The REST reader parses those
responses into the same models the GraphQL reader builds, so the recordings here
describe the same pull request the GraphQL recordings do and the two readers are held to
the same report.
