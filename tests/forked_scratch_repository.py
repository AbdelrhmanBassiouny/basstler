"""
The scratch fork, its upstream, and the operations that move their copies of the default
branch apart.

Testing a step that catches a fork's default branch up needs three copies of that branch
that can genuinely disagree: this clone's, the fork's and the upstream's. All three are
built locally here, laid out under ``<owner>/<name>.git`` so their URLs name a repository
the way GitHub does - which is what lets the stacked-PR configuration resolve which remote
is which, with no network access and no test-only seam in the code under test.

Kept beside :mod:`scratch_repository` rather than in it: every other hook test builds on
that plain clone, and none of them has a fork.
