"""
The throwaway git repository the hook integration tests run against.

Every hook reads git config, fetches a personal-notes branch, or pushes to one, so
testing any of them needs a real repository with a real remote. Both are built locally
here - a project root, and a bare repository standing in for the notes remote - so no
test needs network access or a real personal-notes branch. Beside them sits a scratch
basstler checkout holding the plugin under test, since the plugin lives outside the
project it serves.
